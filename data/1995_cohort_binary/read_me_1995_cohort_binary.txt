The file 1995_cohort_binary.txt contains the data on annual donation incidence for the 1995 cohort of charity supporters as used in Fader, Hardie and Shang (2010). 

Each record in this file, 11104 in total, comprises the following 13 fields:

  Supporter ID
  Ever donate in 1995 (1 = yes, 0 = no)
  Ever donate in 1996
  Ever donate in 1997
  Ever donate in 1998
  Ever donate in 1999
  Ever donate in 2000
  Ever donate in 2001
  Ever donate in 2002
  Ever donate in 2003
  Ever donate in 2004
  Ever donate in 2005
  Ever donate in 2006

Note that the value of the second field is 1 for all records because the defining characteristic of this cohort is that they made their first-ever donation in 1995.
